# XRP
_This application is not intended for financial/trading decisions._


## Setup
Edit the "index.php" file by entering a title, the amount of XRP you own, and the buy-in price of the XRP. CSS and Javascript are inline, no external files are needed except for favicons & touch icons (if you'd like them).
```
$XRP_TITLE = "My XRP Wallet";
$XRP_COUNT = 10;
$XRP_BUYIN = 0.475;
```

## Information
The top of the application will display your wallet's total and will be green for profit or red for loss. Below is a simple table showing what your wallet **started** at and the amount of change from your starting balance to the current balance.

Below that information is a basic high/lowe within a year and a simple graph of 2 months of data.
